      introduction: `In the high-stakes world of business financing and M&A, a single flawed assumption can cascade into million-dollar losses. The spectacular collapse of Theranos serves as a stark reminder: when financial models aren't properly validated, even the most promising ventures can crumble.\n\nAs we navigate through 2025, financial model validation has evolved from a best practice to an absolute necessity.`,

A 2024 McKinsey study found 67% of financial models contain at least one critical error that could materially impact decisions.\n\n- Companies lose an average of $15M annually due to flawed assumptions\n- 43% of M&A deals fail to meet projected synergies due to modeling errors\n- Over 60% of failed startups cite unrealistic projections as a contributing factor` },

The financial models were built on technology that didn't work as promised.\n\nKey lessons:\n- Assumption validation is critical — every model assumption must be stress-tested against reality\n- Independent verification matters — external validation catches what internal teams miss\n- Red flags can't be ignored — when projections seem too good to be true, they usually are` },
        { heading: 'The MARC Validation Framework', content: `1. Structural Integrity Check\n   - Formula accuracy and circular reference detection\n   - Version control and documentation\n\n2.

        { heading: 'The ROI of Validation', content: `For Fundraising: 40% higher success rate securing investment; 25% faster due diligence.\n\nFor M&A: Reduced risk of post-deal surprises; stronger negotiating position.\n\nFor Strategic Planning: More accurate resource allocation; improved board confidence.\n\nOne MARC client avoided a $50M flawed acquisition — the validation cost $150K, a 333x return on investment.` },

It's about building trust, making better decisions, and positioning your business for sustainable growth.
